# Python 3.10 New Features

1. Better error messages

2. split multiple open() as to lines

3. Use | for union types

4. Pattern Matching (PEP 634)
  - "Hello World" demo
  - What can you use as templates:
    [ ] literals
    [ ] capture patterns
    [ ] wildcard patterns
    [ ] constant patterns
    [ ] sequence patterns
    [ ] mapping patterns
    [ ] class patterns
    
  - Guards
  - overriding __eq__ to better match case
  - adding __match_args__ to better match custom classes

5. Pattern Matching IRL
  - handle both int and string differently
  - commands
  - check current date for year/month/day
